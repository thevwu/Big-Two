# Big-Two
This was a BYOND game I was working on in my free time a few years back.  "BYOND" is a game making framework that uses object oriented principles to implement their code.  The game in progress here is called "Big Two" and can also be known as "Thirteen".
The idea of the game is to get rid of all your cards as soon as possible.  The game itself works off the common combinations found in poker.  There are multiple classes in play here including Card, Hand, Deck, a DeckFactory, and a CardCombination class which is incomplete at this moment.

If you wish to view the .DM files, they can be viewed directly in Github or can be viewed using a text editor such as Notepad++.
